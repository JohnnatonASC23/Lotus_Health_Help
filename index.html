        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission at Loutus Health Help is to spread a big problem here in the US, Diabates. Our duty is to acknowledge this issue and spread awareness while also request healthy foods for your healthy living style.</p>

        <h2>Why Diabetes?</h2>
        <p>Diabetes affects 11.3% of Americans, mainly Type 1 and Type 2 cases, with obesity affecting 100.1 million adults and 14.7 million children, costing the healthcare system $147 billion annually.<p>

        <h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3> 
        <p>Type 1 diabetes is where the pancreas does not make insulin, due to the body's immune system attacking the inslet cells in pancreas that creates insulin.</p>

        <h3>Type 2 Diabates</h3>
        <p>Type 2 Diabetes is where the pancreas makes less insulin than used to, so your body becomes resistant to insulin. Resistant to insulin is a condition where cells are less responsive to insulin, often caused by obesity.</p>
