    <h1 id="k">Why our mission matters</h1>
    <p> Our mission matters because diabetes has become a big issue in the United States. With tons of junk food being marketed today, diabetes cases will only grow more. As studies say, diabetes of both types will increase by 54% to more than 54.9 million Americans between 2015 - 2030. Deaths due to diabetes annualy will increase by 38%. Total annual medical and societal costs related to diabetes will increase 53% - to more than $622 billion, according to National Institutes of Health.</p>
    
    <h1 id="k">What we hope to accomplish</h1>
    <p> We hope to spread awareness to people about diabetes. Specifically to reach out to those who have prediabetes and don't know it yet. But also share some info on what foods are good with those who try combating diabetes. Hoepfully our website will decrease the percentages of diabetes throughout the years. </P>

        <h1 id="k"> What was Our Motivation!</h1>
        <h2 id="h"> Our motivation was we got each other and we pushed ourselves to try our best. Crack some jokes here and then. Listen to music while coding, and comment on each others work. If you wanna make a change it starts in your hands...and code.</h2>
